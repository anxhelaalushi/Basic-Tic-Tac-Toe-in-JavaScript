# Basic-Tic-Tac-Toe-in-JavaScript
It's just a basic tic-tac-toe. Might come back and update it later.
I did it based off of Ania Kub√≥w's tutorial. Did the circle and cross a bit different. 
***Reminder for future self: Add a menu; add scores; scores delete when refreshed; menu chooses which is player0 and which is playerx and adds them a name.
